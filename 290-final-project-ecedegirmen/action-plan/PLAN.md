# Action Plan

> Created by Ece Degirmen for COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science


## Instructions:
The final task of your final project is to create an action plan for the project / idea you have come up with. Below serves as a template outlining the expectations for your outline. You will receive full points as long as you make a good-faith effort in creating goals and good tasks for each month. You can also choose which months you would like to include in the 6-month action plan.

Final reminder, please note COMP 290's policies towards generative AI use in the course syllabus:

> All students are expected to follow the guidelines of the UNC Honor Code. Students may use artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT to reinforce or explain concepts, but never to complete assignments, generate code to submit on assignments, or generate text to submit for assignments - ***especially on the final project submission***. Doing so is an Honor Court violation and will result in a 0 on that portion of an assignment. For programming assignment submissions, you must understand and be able to explain any code snippet, derivation, or generated code you make use of in your work if asked by an instructor.

Believe it or not, it is quite easy for instructors to tell when students paste in ChatGPT's responses into their submissions without any editing. If you have any questions towards this policy, please reach out to either Ajay or Noah.
