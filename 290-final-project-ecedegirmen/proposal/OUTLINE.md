# Project Outline
> Created by Ece Degirmen for COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science.

In the project outline, you will specify details about the type of application that you will develop. Your project outline should answer the following questions:

## Project Idea

**What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else?  What will your project do?**

- I’m working on a web application for tracking personal finances and managing investments. It’s supposed to serve as a digital financial companion especially for teens, young adults, college students, etc., by helping them monitor their income, expenses, financial goals and build healthy financial habits. 
- For this final project, I will focus on creating a functional web app that allows users to track their budgets, add financial goals, view transactions, and learn basic investment strategies in a user-friendly dashboard. Initially, users would enter their data manually, but as my project grows, I hope to add an option for bank account syncing using API’s.
- My long-term vision is to create a mobile app version as well and add more complex features with AI. For example, I wish to implement a machine learning model that offers users personalized spending insights or budget suggestions based on their financial data. It could suggest budget adjustments to reach savings goals faster, for example. I also want to make it bit more fun and engaging compared to basic finance apps by including: (1) challenges like “no-spend weekends” or “meal-prep week” that reward users with badges, (2) a feature that allows users to share short-term savings goals, like a study-abroad trip or textbook fund, with friends and family who might want to contribute, (3) a community feature/forum where students can ask for financial advice, share tips, or set shared goals. Eventually, I plan to incorporate social impact initiatives such as offering options to round up spending for charitable donations.


**Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?**

Financial security/wellness is something that affects every area of every individual’s life. I chose this project because even though personal finance is a critical life skill, what I’ve observed, as a college student myself, is that many new adults, especially those from mid/low-income backgrounds and students with debts, feel insecure in this area. My primary focus is to increase the accessibility of financial knowledge and help people build investment habits that set them up for success in the long term. Especially, I aim to help young adults transition more smoothly into adulthood by enabling them to build a habit of self-learning in areas of finance and investment. As an Economics undergraduate, I believe this is a great opportunity for me to combine my academic knowledge with practical software development skills while addressing a real-world problem. Throughout my career, I hope to use technology and economics as a means to increase access to education and the overall quality of life for everyone.

## Project Impact
**Who is the target audience of this project? Be specific about the demographic (age / occupation), the type of devices they might use to run it (computer, Apple phone, smartwatch, etc).**
- Although I eventually want to make it accessible for every demographic, the primary target audience for this app is the age group of 18-24, especially college students. I think this audience would benefit from my app the most because they’re at a stage where they are beginning to take on financial responsibilities, such as managing part-time job income, scholarships, student loans, and other expenses like rent, groceries, textbooks, trips, etc. Therefore, it’s critical for them to understand their financial situation and build foundational money management skills that would benefit them throughout their lives . 
- People of this age group particularly make high use of laptops, desktops, and mobile phones. For the initial stage, I aim to start with a web app because it ensures that I can reach a broad audience without needing to focus on a specific operating system like iOS. Though Apple devices are widely used in the U.S, in my home country Türkiye, for example, only about 20% of people use Apple devices, as they’re costly for many. In the future though, I’d like to make the mobile versions available across different operating systems such as Apple iOS, Android, etc. But for now, I know that many students rely on laptops or desktops for detailed tasks, and I think that managing finances could easily become one of those routine habits thanks to a web app. 


**What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your project?**

The primary problem my project aims to tackle is the lack of accessible and user-friendly tools for college students to manage their personal finances effectively. Unfortunately, many students face challenges in budgeting, tracking expenses, and understanding the basics of saving and investing. By the time they finish school and step into the workforce, many are burdened with college debts and loans while having to figure out how to land jobs, pay bills, and even make family plans. While there are existing financial apps, they are often overwhelming and too complex for beginners, or many of them ask for a paid subscription. My hope for this app to be like a personal financial advisor for people who wish to improve their financial skills. I want everything to be as beginner friendly as possible because I want this app to serve as an educational tool that is accessible for people who would need it the most. My objective is to encourage adolescents and young adults to take more initiatives and make them feel more capable as a person as they step into the real world. I’m hoping that, with the help of this app, they’ll be able to make informed decisions about where to spend, where to save, and how to start planning for their financial future early on in their lives.
